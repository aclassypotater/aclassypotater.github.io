<p>10.attendance tracker <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/hamza-ebeida/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">link</a><br> good idea but very little coding involved, plus a system for that is already present in the school yet they have not implemented for attendance</p>
<p>9.momentum based fighting game <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/eric-steiner/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">link</a><br> I want to develop a game but there are already 4 people on this one</p>
<p>8.tv 360 <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/austin-dlugosch/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">link</a><br> i like the idea but it would be mostly hardware/mechanical engineering, which is beyond me</p>
<p>7.code learning app <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/devin-wingfield/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">link</a><br> Sounds fun to develop but no demand for it, also would require mastery the langauges to properly teach it</p>
<p>6.3d Rendering algorithim <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-jershin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">link</a><br> I like the idea of messing with rendering algorithims but the proposal was way too ambitious </p>
<p>5.Bolt <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/george-winters/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">link</a><br> Sounds like a good project, but unnessacary as communication platforms are very common. </p>
